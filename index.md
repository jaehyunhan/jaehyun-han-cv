## üé® **Hobbies/Things I Enjoy**
**Baking**: Huge fan of healthy-ish Levain-style cookies and muffins, as seen [here](https://www.instagram.com/jaehyunstimeandenergy). <br/>
**Ceramics**: I'm a beginner potter! View made-by-Jaehyun collection [here](https://www.instagram.com/jaehyunstimeandenergy). <br/>
**Personal Blog**: In 2021, I started a [personal blog](https://blog.naver.com/wogus981109) as a means to communicate with my family and friends back home in South Korea, at a more personal and vulnerable level -- just like an open diary. I try not to shy away from being myself in my writing, and it has tremendously helped me with writing, sorting out emotions, and mental health. The most common contents are my daily walks, home-made foods/bakery goods, and ideas for personal and professional growth. <br/>
**Time in Nature**: These are my favorite places to wonder around in [Seoul](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Bukhansan/@37.6608321,126.9845782,2727m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x357cbdd5b945eccf:0xfb9486536d6d79f9!8m2!3d37.660833!4d126.993333), [Columbus](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Blendon+Woods+Metro+Park/@40.07487,-82.9173907,10546m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m9!1m2!2m1!1sbrenden+woods+metro+park!3m5!1s0x8838606908985b07:0x42199958120751e6!8m2!3d40.07487!4d-82.8823718!15sChhicmVuZGVuIHdvb2RzIG1ldHJvIHBhcmtaGiIYYnJlbmRlbiB3b29kcyBtZXRybyBwYXJrkgEEcGFya5oBI0NoWkRTVWhOTUc5blMwVkpRMEZuU1VSQmRrMVVMVmRCRUFF), and Washington D.C., but my all-time favorite is surely [here](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Chiri-san/@35.3369436,127.7218007,2811m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x356e4c7b8a83dafd:0x3f72563fe6e62f59!8m2!3d35.3369444!4d127.7305555). <br/>
